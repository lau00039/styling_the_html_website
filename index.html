            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <h5> January 28<sup>th</sup> 2021 </h5>

                <p>I was born in Canada and moved to Hong Kong with my family when I was three years old. 
                   I like traveling to different cities, taking pictures of nice sceneries, and shooting amazing food photos. 
                   I also love multicultural food, creating various recipes and cook for my beloved ones has always been my passion.            
                        </p>
                <p>I am grateful to study courses, which I have always been interested in. 
                   <abbr title="Interactive Media Design"><strong>IMD</strong> </abbr>
                   gives me the opportunity to improve on my photography skills 
                   and learn how to design websites. 
                   Hopefully, I can design my own website in the future 
                   and share my food photos and recipes to foodies like <del>me</del>ALL OF US.                                   
                        </p>
